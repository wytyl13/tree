 * @Description: B tree, util here, we have learned binary search tree, then we will
 * learn about B tree, a search tree, but it is not a binary tree.
 * notice, AVL tree is dedicate to do some search working. and the more
 * advanced tree we will learn is dedicated to insert and delete working.
 * so if you has not amount of insert and delete working, you can just use the 
 * AVL tree, because it is dedicated to searching working.
 * B- tree, B+ tree, and red black tree are dedicated to insert and delete working.
